# Snake Game
This is a simple version of the snake game where users can control the snake using the arrow keys to move around the board and eat fruits in order to grow larger.
## Description
The game includes a starting screen with directions on how to play and a button to start the game. The game keeps track of the score as the snake eats the fruits and also keeps track of the highest score. The highest score is saved in local storage so the highest score will still be visible if the game is closed and opened again. After the game ends, the user is given the option to play again and also reset the highest score back to 0.
## What I learned
* Changing the visibility of certain elements
* Using the canvas element in HTML and customizing it using JavaScript
* Using the setInterval method to continuously update the game
* Obtained more experience using the EventTarget interface as well as localStorage
